P1,P2 are pointers
I1,I2 are integers

P1 + P2 = Invalid
P1 - P2 = Integer
P1 * P2 = Invalid
P1 / P2 = Invalid

P1 + I1 = Pointer
P1 - I1 = Pointer
P1 * I1 = Invalid
P1 / I1 = Invalid

I1 + I2 = Integer
I1 - I2 = Integer
I1 * I2 = Integer
I1 / I2 = Integer

+  can be P1 + I1, I1 + I2
-  can be P1 - P2, P1 - I1, I1 - I2
*  can be I1 * I2
/  can be I1 / I2

1) A variable is a pointer if it is used to load/store another variable in memory.
2) Signed/Unsigned integer can be determined from branch statements and other hints.
3) Integer or String can be determined depending on how it is used.
E.g. If it is used as the format variable in a printf() it is a string.
If it is used in the variable args of a printf() statement and the format string identifies it as %s is it a string.
